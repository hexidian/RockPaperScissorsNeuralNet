# RockPaperScissorsNeuralNet
this is for making a rock paper scissors neural network which will try and anticipate the player's moves based on their past moves.

  how to use:

The computer will print it's decision before you so you know it isn't cheating. You will need to then enter your decision so it can learn.
You should already know your next move before you input the last one because the computer will print it's move immediately.
